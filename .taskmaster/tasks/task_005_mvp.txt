# Description: Develop the user interface for connecting YouTube channels to the application after authentication
# Details:

2. Implement UI components for channel selection:
   - Channel card component with channel thumbnail, name, and subscriber count
   - Selection confirmation modal
   - Loading states for API requests
3. Create API endpoint for saving selected channel to database
4. Implement channel connection flow:
   - Fetch user's YouTube channels after authentication
   - Display available channels for selection
   - Save selected channel to database
   - Redirect to dashboard after selection
5. Add error handling for failed channel connections
6. Implement UI for managing connected channels
7. Create channel disconnection functionality

# Test Strategy:
Test the channel connection flow by authenticating with a test account and verifying channels are displayed correctly. Test channel selection and confirm data is saved to the database. Verify error states display appropriate messages. Test channel disconnection functionality. Ensure UI is responsive across different screen sizes.
