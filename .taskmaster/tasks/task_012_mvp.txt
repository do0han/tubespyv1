# Test Strategy:
Test deployment by pushing changes to the repository and verifying automatic deployment. Verify environment variables are correctly set in production. Test the application in production environment to ensure all features work correctly. Verify database connections work in production. Test performance metrics like page load times. Verify error tracking is working correctly by simulating errors.
